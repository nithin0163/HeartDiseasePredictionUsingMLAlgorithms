# HeartDiseasePredictionUsingMLAlgorithms
This project is about predicting the chances of occuring heart attack using hybrid machine learning Algorithms. This Hybrid Machine learning Algorithm called "HRFLM"(Hybrid Random forest with linear Model) produces better results compared to conventional models such as SVM,DT,RF,Logistic regression etc.
The performance measures such as Precision,F1-Measure,Recall,Accuracy are considered to evaluate the hybrid model. The data that is used for this project is collected from the UCI.
